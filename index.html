            <!-- My Background -->
            <p class="my-background"> Recently I graduated with an MBA from Seattle University and currently taking up a Web Development course at UW. During my MBA program, I very specifically opted for courses to hone my business strategic skills and also specialized in data analytics. I'm taking up the coding bootcamp to equip myself for opportunities in the tech industry specifically in Product Management. <br>  <br>  Before I got here, I have very diverse experience in a couple of different sectors - mainly banking and manufacturing. My most recent work experience was in qatar for a large bank in the corporate side where i was playing a vital role in implementing a lot of process optimization techniques which I feel are some important skills for a project manager. And before that, I was working with promoting a new product in a new market.  </p>
